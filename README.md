# 🌧️ Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Machine Learning** techniques to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical weather data. The goal is to develop a reliable classification model that helps in weather forecasting and decision-making.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data trends, correlations, and distributions.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Implementing models like **Random Forest, CatBoost, and LightGBM**.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance for better accuracy.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying key factors influencing rainfall prediction.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes historical weather data with multiple features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. It has been preprocessed to improve data quality before feeding it into ML models.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM
- **Notebook Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle

## 📊 Model Performance
Several models were tested, with **Random Forest and CatBoost** delivering the best results. Further improvements were explored through hyperparameter tuning and feature selection.

## 📌 Results & Insights
- **Humidity, pressure, and wind speed** were key predictors of rainfall.
- **Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning** significantly improved accuracy.
- **Tree-based models** performed better than linear models due to their ability to capture non-linear patterns.
